# MagicFX for Oblivion Reloaded
This is a collection of shaders and effects, plus an init script, for use with Oblivion Reloaded. Still a work in progress, expect bugs.

To install, simply copy ```batch```  and ```Data``` to Oblivion's folder and replace anything there, make sure to do a backup before that though. Obviously requires Oblivion Reloaded.
